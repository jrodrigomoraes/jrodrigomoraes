###  About Me

-  I have a strong foundation in **Data Analysis** and currently build end-to-end **Data Engineering** solutions, from ingestion to visualization
-  Currently deep-diving into **cloud computing (AWS)**, **big data tools**, and **machine learning pipelines**
-  Main stack: `Python`, `SQL`, `PySpark`, `PostgreSQL`, `Airflow`, `AWS (S3, Redshift, RDS, Kinesis, Athena, Glue)`
-  Strong believer in **version control**, clean code and reproducibility
-  I love building small games, automations, and challenging data pipelines

###  Projects

I focus on building **data engineering solutions** that combine cloud services, automation, and analytics. My projects aim to:

-  Design robust **data pipelines** for structured and unstructured data
-  Implement **real-time streaming architectures** using services like `Kinesis`
-  Apply **machine learning models** with distributed processing frameworks like `PySpark` and `MLlib`
-  Build **analytical data warehouses** and connect them to BI dashboards for ad hoc insights
-  Explore orchestration tools and cloud services to enhance automation and scalability
-  Simulate IoT sensor data and orchestrate its `ETL` flow using `Apache Airflow` with file monitoring, conditional logic, database storage, and alerting.
